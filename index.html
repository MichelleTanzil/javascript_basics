                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScriptis extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objecteds of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

                            JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Assignment Operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pound in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span>
                        </p>

                            Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false</span>; null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks"</span>; Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. These are the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span>  we execute this block of code;
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!

                            Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
